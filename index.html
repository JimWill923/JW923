            Greetings everyone, I am Jimmy Williams, I am from Greene County NC which is A small county population wise located about an hour east of Raleigh. I am a
            vegetarian and I have been for 21 years. I like to tra vel I have travelled up and down the east coast and I have been to 3 other countries but I have 
            never been to the western part of the United States.
            I enjoy surfing the web for information, streaming videos or either shopping.  I went to Pitt Community College in Winterville NC where I studied computer programming. I think the ability to work remote from any location is what first peaked my interest in the Software Developer career path. 
            I also think it is a career field that will not disappear anytime soon. The internet and technology is constantly growing. I think there will be a need for more developers 
            in the future. I would like to create great internet content that I can be proud to say I designed that page. 
            </p>
